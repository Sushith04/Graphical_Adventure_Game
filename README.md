The world for our game consists of a dungeon, a network of tunnels and caves that are interconnected so that player can explore the entire world by traveling from cave to cave through the tunnels that connect them. Each location in the grid represents a location in the dungeon where a player can explore and can be connected to at most four other locations - North, South, East, West. Here's where everything becomes challenging because the player won't be able to see the locations that they haven't visited. However, the player receives hints about items and monsters situated in the dungeon so that they can reach the end cave.
